#  Access Hub - Authentication System

**Access Hub** is a modern, secure authentication system built using **React** and a **Node.js backend**, designed to demonstrate real-world authentication flows such as protected routes, login redirection, and local storage handling.

This project focuses on **clean architecture**, **user experience**, and **scalable authentication logic**, making it suitable for production use and a strong addition to a developer portfolio.

---

## Features

###  Implemented
- User **Signup & Login**
- **JWT-based authentication**
- **Protected routes** using React Router
- Automatic **redirection after login**
  - Users are redirected back to the page they originally tried to access
- Secure **logout**
- Clean UI styled with **Tailwind CSS**
- Notifications using **React Toastify**
- API communication via **Axios**

---

## 🧭 Authentication Flow

- New users sign up → redirected to login
- Logged-in users are redirected to the **Dashboard**
- Protected pages (e.g., Profile) require authentication
- If a user tries to access a protected route while logged out:
  - They are redirected to the login page
  - After successful login, they are redirected **back to the original page**

This behavior closely mirrors real-world authentication systems used in production apps.
